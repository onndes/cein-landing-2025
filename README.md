# 🛍️ CEIN — Fashion Landing Page (2025 Practice)

A non-commercial, single-page layout (HTML/CSS only) practicing modern front-end techniques for a fictional fashion e-commerce brand.

## 🎯 Motivation & Project Scope

This repository marks the start of a **personal skill restoration initiative** following an extended break.

The primary objective is to **re-establish core development muscle memory** and ensure seamless integration back into current front-end practices. The focus is strictly on foundational implementation:

> The code is intentionally executed **without excessive optimization or perfectionism**, prioritizing **clear execution and fundamental practice** over complex architectural patterns. This is a practice environment, not production code.

## 📜 P.S. — Personal Development Plan

My current primary plan is a **long-term, two-year initiative** to thoroughly restore core knowledge and study the fundamentals **in detail**. This calm, unhurried pace is necessary due to a significant lack of available study time. The technologies I previously mastered include: HTML, SCSS, JS, TS, React, Redux, Redux-Toolkit, Axios, Next.js, and Firebase.

Going forward, the goal is to practice other frameworks and backend development to avoid being just a "React boyar" 😂.
